                Hello, I'm Thomas Cleary, a student at Shepherd University studying Computer and Information Technology. I'm passionate about web development and proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and Python. I have experience with both relational and nonrelational databases, including MongoDB and MySQL. I'm familiar with tools like Figma, VS Code, and Postman, and have some exposure to Amazon Web Services. Let's collaborate and bring ideas to life with React or Node.js!
